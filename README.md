Hi! My name is Matthew Griggs. I'm a current student at the University of Arkansas, getting a degree in Information Systems: Blockchain Systems,
and will start my graduate degree in 2025 at Southern Methodist University, in Computer Science: Artificial Intelligence!

I'm interested in Artificial Intelligence, Software Engineering, Machine Learning, and Blockchain technologies.

I'm currently learning machine learning and more advanced artificial intelligence concepts.
